# Multiple_linear_regression

I have completed the "Machine Learning : A-Z" course delivered on udemy platform.

In this project, I have implemented the Multiple linear regression model to predict the profit for startups depending upon startup's R&D spent, Administration spent and its strategic location.

Following python libraries are used to implement multiple linear regression:
Pandas - for data preprocessing.
Numpy - for data preprocessing.
sklearn - to implement the linear regression model.
matplotlib - to plot the results

Dataset:
50_Startup.csv - attached in repository
